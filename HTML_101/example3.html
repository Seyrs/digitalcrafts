Here's what I like about lists:
    <ul> Theyre useful for displaying lists of stuff
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>
<div> When you make a list, do it in this order:</div>

    <ol> 
        <li> if it's an ordered list or not </li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
        <li>Use li tages nested in the list for your list items</li>
            <ul> 
                <li> Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other </li>
            </ul>
        <li>You've got this, I belive in me!</li>
    </ol>
