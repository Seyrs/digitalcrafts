/**
 * Vending Machine Group Exercise
Vending Machines give us the ability to buy food and drink anywhere we go! You are hired as a contractor to write a vending machine application for a new line of vending machines to be released.
The vending machine will have the following items and prices:
Snickers  $1.25
Popcorn   $1.00
Chewing Gum $0.25
Nuts $0.50
Cookies $1.70
Cup Noodles $2.25
The vending machine can accept the following currency:
Nickel $0.05
Dime $0.10
Quarter $.25
Dollar $1.00
When a person is buying from the vending machine, the following happen:
- A list of items is shown to them with the prices
- They insert money into the machine based on the allowed currency above
- They then select their item and the following can happen:
-- If the amount entered is less than what the item cost, an error message is produced stating they have not entered enough money
-- If the amount is equal to or above the amount of the item, they should get their item and left over change, if any
-- If they do not choose an item, all the money can be returned to them
Your task is to create a simulation in which 5 different buyers attempt to buy an item from the vending machine. Remember everything we have learned in class to use are your disposal:
- If Statements
- For Loops
- Arrays
- Objects
- Functions
With a partner, please discuss the problem by laying each piece of the problem 1 step at a time, and work your way through the problem.
